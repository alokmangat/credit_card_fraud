## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a serious financial issue that affects both consumers and financial institutions. Machine learning helps identify patterns in transaction data to detect anomalous or fraudulent behaviour. This project uses a publicly available credit card transaction dataset to build models that can classify transactions as **fraudulent** or **genuine** with high accuracy. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
